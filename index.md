## Final Project

### My adventure into CircuitPython

After contemplating how I wanted to use what I've learned this class for what seemed like ages,
I found the courage to put the brakes on the idea I initially began working to finish off this course.
I realized this course and the way it was structured was more than just proving I can write function equations, but
realizing how programming can be a tool in my life as well as a creative outlet. I began to see the light in how I can use
python the create something that I think is awesome, an idea I never felt with my initial project. After a short discussion 
in one of Dr. Benton's weekly team meetings, I saw the ability to write code to control led lights for virtually any application.
Specifically, Dr. Benton showed me a pair of super-PLUR custom LED glasses which I frankly thought were epic. It was after this 
meeting in which my adenture into CircuitPython began. 

### Materials

- 3.7v 500mAh battery
- 1/2 m DotStar LED strip

- Adafruit Feather m0 Express

### Findings

After reaseraching and understanding the basics of how to correctly wire the LED strip to this controller, I found a red flag. 
I had assumed that the 3.7v battery that plugs into the Feather m0 would also be the source of power for the LED's. This
unfortunatley turned to be untrue as a LED strip of the size I purchased requires 5 volts for operation. This slightly complicates things 
as now a second power source must be wired in. 

I found this universal 5 volt power adapter that comes with the correct (highlighted) adapter piece to easily wire in a power connection.

With this new information I had to understand how I would include the input power lines for the LED's and where they reside on the m0.
